            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite.</p>
            <p>Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.25 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.25 times. The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.</p>
            <p>Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases, including carbon dioxide, argon, and water vapor. This mixture of gases creates a protective layer that shields life from harmful solar radiation and keeps the planet warm through the greenhouse effect.</p>
            <p>The planet's surface is approximately 71% water, with the remaining 29% consisting of continents and islands. Earth's diverse environments, ranging from tropical rainforests to polar ice caps, support a vast array of life forms. The biosphere, which includes all living organisms, interacts with the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere, creating a complex and dynamic system.</p>
            <p>Human activities have significantly impacted Earth's environment. Deforestation, pollution, and climate change are major challenges that threaten the planet's ecosystems and biodiversity. Efforts to promote sustainability and protect the environment are crucial to ensuring a healthy and habitable Earth for future generations.</p>
